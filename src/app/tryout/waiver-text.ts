2. WAIVER OF LIABILITY
I, on behalf of myself, my heirs, personal representatives, and assigns, hereby release, waive, and forever discharge the Club, its officers, organizers, members, agents, employees, volunteers, and any affiliated facility owners or operators from any and all liability, claims, demands, actions, or causes of action arising out of or related to any loss, damage, or injury, including death, that may be sustained by me while participating in any Club activities, whether caused by negligence or otherwise.

3. MEDICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I certify that I am physically fit and have no medical condition that would prevent my full participation in basketball activities. I understand the Club does not provide medical personnel at its sessions. I agree to assume responsibility for my own medical care and expenses in the event of injury.

4. INDEMNIFICATION
I agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Club and its organizers, members, and agents from any loss, liability, damage, or costs, including attorney fees, that they may incur due to my participation in Club activities, whether caused by my negligence or otherwise.

I HAVE READ THIS ASSUMPTION OF RISK, WAIVER OF LIABILITY, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, AND UNDERSTAND THAT I AM GIVING UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING MY RIGHT TO SUE. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND INTEND MY SIGNATURE TO BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.`;
